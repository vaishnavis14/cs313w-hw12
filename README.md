This program calculates the maximum number of boxes that can fit inside each other based on their dimensions, as well as the number of distinct nesting sets that achieve this maximum. The code utilizes a recursive memoization approach to efficiently determine which boxes can be nested, considering all possible orientations. The implementation reads a list of boxes from standard input, processes the dimensions, and outputs the results.
